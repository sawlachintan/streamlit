# IPL 2024 Score Prediction

Welcome to the IPL 2024 Score Prediction web app! This app provides predictions of the runs scored by the batting team in an IPL match based on various features including the opponents, overs played, boundaries scored, wickets lost, and more.

## Features:

-   **Prediction Model**: The app employs a Random Forest model to estimate the runs scored by the batting team. This model is implemented using the popular scikit-learn library in Python.

-   **Inspiration**: This project was inspired by the insightful video content created by [Satyajit Pattnaik](https://www.youtube.com/@SatyajitPattnaik).
